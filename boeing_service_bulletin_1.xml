  <summary>
    <background>
      In March 2019, aviation authorities around the world grounded the 737-8 and 737-9 airplanes after two airplane crashes occurred within a period of five months. As a result of the groundings, affected operators canceled their flights and Boeing halted 737-8 and 737-9 deliveries and reduced production. All affected airplanes were put into Active Storage or Prolonged Parking.

    <title>OPERATIONAL READINESS FLIGHT</title>
    <section>
      <title>1. Operational Readiness Flight Recommendations</title>
      <content>
        Boeing considers an operationally representative flight profile sufficiently rigorous for exposing anomalies not uncovered during a thorough and disciplined maintenance depreservation activity. Such a flight could be done on a re-positioning flight from its storage location. During the operational readiness flight, flight crews can exercise airplane systems in accordance with normal Flight Crew Operations Manual (FCOM) procedures, with emphasis on expected system functionality. Supplementary Procedures may also be used as needed, conditions permitting.
        An operational readiness flight of an airplane that has been depreserved needs to abide by all certified Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) and FCOM limitations.

    </section>
    <section>
      <title>2. Operational Readiness Flight Profile</title>
      <content>
        An Operational Readiness Flight includes the following phases of flight utilizing Normal Procedures and appropriate Supplementary Procedures as needed, conditions permitting:
        Preflight - verification of proper switch positions, circuit breaker status, fluid quantities, discrepancies and overall configuration.
        Takeoff - normal flight instrument and engine indications, normal landing gear and flap retraction.
        Taxi - normal brakes and steering.
        Climb - normal flight instrument and engine indications, automatic air conditioning and pressurization systems (air conditioning temperature range control and response), and anti-ice systems (conditions permitting).
        Cruise - at a cruise altitude at or above 20,000 ft. MSL, normal flight instrument and engine indications, automatic air conditioning and pressurization systems.
        Descent - normal automatic air conditioning and pressurization systems performance, normal speedbrake extension and retraction.
        Approach - normal flight instrument indications, normal flap extension, normal landing gear extension.
        Landing - normal speedbrake extension, normal automatic and manual braking, reverse thrust operation, automatic pressurization system.
        Taxi In and Shutdown - verification of normal depressurization, fluid quantities and any abnormalities.
